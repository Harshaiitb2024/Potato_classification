Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants.
• Used image classification using CNN and built a DL model which a farmer can take a picture and model will tell
us if the plant has a disease or not. Data Augmetation is also involved since ,I had a small data for training.
• To serve the model, built a FastAPI web server and tested it using postman application.
